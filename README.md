# I Luoghi della Saga Tebana
Project of digital storytelling created as part of my 1st level degree's thesis in "GREEK ABD ROMAN CLASSICAL THEATRE" aiming to show how GIS models can be
applied to improve the analyses of literary text, here specifically applied to the case study of the Oedipus' myth as represented in the fifth century Greek tragedy.
the result is viewable at the following <a href="arcg.is/0imyqz0">link</a>.
